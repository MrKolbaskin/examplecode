    biological_description: The detection of androgen receptor splice variant-7 (AR-V7)
      mRNA in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) correlated with poor outcomes from the
      use of abiraterone and enzalutamide in patients with castration-resistant prostate
      cancer (CRPC). The androgen receptor (AR), also known as NR3C4 (nuclear receptor
      subfamily 3, group C, member 4), is a type of nuclear receptor that is activated
      by binding any of the androgenic hormones, including testosterone and dihydrotestosterone[9]
      in the cytoplasm and then translocating into the nucleus. The androgen receptor
      is most closely related to the progesterone receptor, and progestins in higher
      dosages can block the androgen receptor. The main function of the androgen receptor
      is as a DNA-binding transcription factor that regulates gene expression;[12]
      however, the androgen receptor has other functions as well. Androgen regulated
      genes are critical for the development and maintenance of the male sexual phenotype.
      AR-V7 is an androgen receptor splice variant that can be detected in circulating
      tumor cells of metastatic prostate cancer patients and is predictive of resistance
      to some drugs

  meta_info:
    biologicalNCBI: 'The androgen receptor gene is more than 90 kb long and codes
      for a protein that has 3 major functional domains: the N-terminal domain, DNA-binding
      domain, and androgen-binding domain. The protein functions as a steroid-hormone
      activated transcription factor. Upon binding the hormone ligand, the receptor
      dissociates from accessory proteins, translocates into the nucleus, dimerizes,
      and then stimulates transcription of androgen responsive genes. This gene contains
      2 polymorphic trinucleotide repeat segments that encode polyglutamine and polyglycine
      tracts in the N-terminal transactivation domain of its protein. Expansion of
      the polyglutamine tract from the normal 9-34 repeats to the pathogenic 38-62
      repeats causes spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA, also known as Kennedy''s
      disease). Mutations in this gene are also associated with complete androgen
      insensitivity (CAIS). Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants
      encoding different isoforms.'
    biologicalUniprot: 'Receptor for the chemotactic and inflammatory peptide anaphylatoxin
      C5a. The ligand interacts with at least two sites on the receptor: a high-affinity
      site on the extracellular N-terminus, and a second site in the transmembrane
      region which activates downstream signaling events. Receptor activation stimulates
      chemotaxis, granule enzyme release, intracellular calcium release and superoxide
      anion production.'
